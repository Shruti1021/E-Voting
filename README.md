# E-Voting
Codefundo++ 2019

Our main idea is to make a web application on android studio which will allow secure e-voting to the users with the help of azure blockchain.
Some features of our app-
1.	A person who may be living in a location other than the constituency where he/she is registered as a voter can also vote through our app. Our app logins a user through EPIC number which is unique for every voter and the state where he is registered as a voter with the help of government database record of voters list with 1 level of security (Captcha). So any voter can vote online despite of where he/she is living.
2.	Transparency of Voting with no accusation of  hacked EVMs, as we are using azure blockchain for secure voting through our app. Using blockchain we'll encrypt every Voter and their vote which cannot be changed or manipulated and thus ensure secure and transparent voting. Votes could be verified right after the voting is finished.
3.	Counting can be done within very less time through our app.  Since Voting is done online, the counting time can be reduced significantly from few days to few minutes.  Counting is totally reliable as the count of votes are encrypted using Blockchain and there is no involvement of centralised authority.  Also, the whole election can be contested on a single day inspite of breaking the process in phases. This will cut done the huge cost of transporting EVM machines, ensuring their security and will reduce the man power required.
Also, since the whole process will be over within a day, the probability of tampering data (which is encrypted) vanishes.
4.	We plan to display some important information like the political ideology and background of every contestant through our app so that people can make a right choice while voting. 
5.	A person if eligible and his/her name is in the voters list can vote online. Anyone can check if their name is in voter list or not with the help of government database record of voters list.  If not the user can also apply for voter id through our app (if eligible).
